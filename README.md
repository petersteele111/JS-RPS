# Welcome to my JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) Game

## What it does
So this game was simply created to prove a point to someone that I am helping and to show them some alternate ways to do something. It allows the user to click on some images and play RPS against a computer.

## Who its for
This game can be played by anyone or used by anyone to see the workings of how to build such a game. It is rather simple, but instead of using a ton of If, Else If, Else statements, we mathematically declare a winner.

## License 
Open source baby, do what you will with it. Improve it, use it as a starting template to make something visually stunning, whatever you want to do!

## Contact
